## Calories per pound of food

approximate calories per pound of food based on a very rough approximation: calories from macronutrients, 1/3 from fat, 1/3 from carbs, 1/3 from protein:

Fat: 9 kcal per gram
Carbohydrates: 4 kcal per gram
Protein: 4 kcal per gram
1 pound = 454 grams


Assuming a day's worth of food is roughly 1/3 fat, 1/3 carb, and 1/3 protein.


Breakdown:
- 151.3 grams of fat is 1361.7 Kcal
- 151.3 grams of carbs is 605.2 Kcal
- 151.3 grams of protein is 605.2 Kcal


Total:
- 1 pound of food â‰ˆ 1,361.7 + 605.2 + 605.2 = 2,572 kcal per pound
